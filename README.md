# K-means-algorithm-
K -means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups).  
The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable  K . The algorithm works iteratively 
to assign each data point to one of  K  groups based on the features that are provided

Clustering 
“Clustering” is the process of grouping similar entities together. The goal of this unsupervised machine learning technique is to find similarities
in the data point and group similar data points together.
